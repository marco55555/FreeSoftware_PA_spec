Introduction 
===========================================================================================================

[bla bla]

The Vision and Mission of the [X] Initiative are as follows:

-   **Vision**: [bla bla].

-   **Mission**: [bla bla].

In accordance with the Vision and Mission, this specification defines a
set of requirements that if met, would significantly increase the
probability that [bla bla]; although a 
program that satisfies all the specification requirements does not
guarantee full compliance. The requirements represent a base level
(minimum) set of requirements a program must satisfy to be considered
[X] Conforming. The specification focuses on the “what” and “why”
qualities of a compliance program as opposed to the “how” and “when”
considerations. This ensures a practical level of flexibility that
enables different organizations to tailor their policies and processes
to best fit their objectives.

Section 2 introduces definitions of key terms used throughout the
specification. Section 3 presents the specification requirements where
each one has a list of one or more Verification Artifacts. They
represent the evidence that must exist in order for a given requirement
to be considered satisfied. If all the requirements have been met for a
given program, it would be considered [X] Conforming in accordance
with version 1.0 of the specification.
